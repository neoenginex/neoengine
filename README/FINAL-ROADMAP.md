---

## 🚀 The Path to 100% Functionality

### **⏱️ Estimated Time: 2-3 Hours Total**

### **Phase 1: Get IPFS Service (15 mins)**
```bash
1. Go to https://pinata.cloud
2. Create free account 
3. Get JWT token
4. Add to .env: EXPO_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT="your_jwt"
5. Test image uploads work
```

### **Phase 2: Deploy Smart Contracts (30 mins)**
```bash
1. Install Solana CLI + Anchor
2. anchor build
3. anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
4. Update program IDs in contracts
5. Run anchor test to verify
```

### **Phase 3: Connect Frontend (45 mins)**
```typescript
// Create utils/profileContract.ts
// Update screens/CreateProfile.tsx
// Update hooks/useUserProfile.ts
// Test complete flow: PIN → Username → Profile → Success
```

### **Phase 4: Remove Supabase Dependencies (20 mins)**
```sql
-- Keep only messaging/social tables
-- Remove profile storage from frontend
-- Test app restart preserves profiles
```

### **Phase 5: Testing & Polish (30 mins)**
```bash
# Test critical user flows
# Fix any edge cases
# Deploy to testflight/play console
```
