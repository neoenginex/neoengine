# 🚀 NeoEngine - Complete Project Documentation

**MASTER README - Contains all existing project information compiled**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**NeoEngine is a decentralized peer-to-peer infrastructure network built on Solana that transforms mobile devices into revenue-generating nodes while powering the next generation of Web3 applications.**

### **What NeoEngine Does:**
- **Mobile-First Mining**: Users earn $DSX tokens by contributing device resources
- **Social Identity Platform**: Permanent @handles with evolving NFT profiles
- **Resource Sharing Network**: CPU/GPU/RAM/Storage/Bandwidth pooling
- **Community-Powered AI**: Distributed training of ne0 AI using shared resources
- **Gamified Experience**: TF2-style cosmetics, achievements, and guild competition

---

## 🏗️ Current Architecture Status

### ✅ **Working Features**
- 🔐 **PIN Security System** - Device-level authentication
- 👤 **Username Creation** - @handle claiming with validation
- 🎨 **Profile Creation** - Name, bio, images, metadata
- 🖼️ **Dynamic Profile Icons** - User's pfp in all headers
- 🌐 **IPFS Integration** - Centralized pinning architecture
- 🗄️ **Supabase Integration** - Social features and caching

### ⚠️ **Needs Implementation** (Priority)
- ⛓️ **Smart Contract Deployment** - Deploy to devnet/mainnet
- 🔌 **Blockchain Integration** - Connect frontend to contracts
- 🔄 **Mining System Implementation** - Multi-resource contribution system
- 💰 **Fee Payment System** - Gas + IPFS cost handling

---

## 📱 Identity Layer Architecture

### **Three-Tier Identity System:**

**1. SBT @Handles (Permanent Identity)**
- Non-transferable username tokens
- Permanent, cannot be taken away
- Survives platform changes, wallet transfers
- Format: @username (3-20 characters)

**2. Profile NFTs (Evolving Identity)**
- Mutable metadata containers
- Updateable images, bio, website
- Badge and achievement system
- Cosmetic customization slots

**3. Username Trading (Optional)**
- Separate tradable username NFTs
- Premium handles can be bought/sold
- Distinct from permanent SBT handles

## 💎 Economic Model

### **User Fee Structure:**
- **Profile Operations**: ~0.016 SOL ($0.50-2.00)
- **Covers**: Gas costs + IPFS pinning + platform fee
- **Mining Rewards**: $DSX tokens for resource contribution
- **Scaling**: NeoEngine controls all storage costs

### **$DSX Token Distribution (50M Supply):**
